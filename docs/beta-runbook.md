# Founding Beta Runbook

## Launch Checklist

1. Apply the three July 2026 migrations in order: session outcomes, session laps,
   then beta foundation.
2. Set `BETA_INVITE_ONLY=true`, a long random `BETA_INVITE_SECRET`, and a distinct
   `BETA_FORM_RATE_LIMIT_SECRET` in the deployment environment.
3. Deploy and verify the public home page, waitlist, invitation signup, session
   capture, comparison, and outcome flows.
4. Recruit twelve motorcycle track-day riders who expect at least two track dates
   in the next 90 days.

Never change `BETA_INVITE_SECRET` while active invitations exist; invitation hashes
cannot be recovered after rotation.

## Invite a Rider

```bash
npm run beta:invite -- create rider@example.com
```

The command prints the plaintext code once. Send it only to the matching email
owner. Optional flags set invite validity and cohort:

```bash
npm run beta:invite -- create rider@example.com --days 7 --cohort motorcycle-founding
```

Every accepted rider receives all Pro capabilities for 90 days from redemption,
without a Stripe subscription.

## Weekly Founder Review

```bash
npm run beta:report
```

Review the quantitative report alongside rider interviews. At minimum, inspect:

- accepted riders who log sessions on two distinct track dates;
- comparison views followed by saved outcomes;
- AI recommendations linked to later outcomes;
- comparison and AI usefulness scores;
- the percentage who would be very disappointed if the product disappeared;
- capture duration and safety or trust concerns from interviews.

## Decision Gate

Run the formal review when twelve riders have accepted and eight have logged two
distinct track dates, or after 90 days—whichever comes first.

- Continue and deepen motorcycle workflows when repeat use, usefulness, and trust
  clear the gate.
- Narrow the loop when riders log but do not compare or record outcomes.
- Rework guidance when comparisons are useful but AI scores or trust are weak.
- Test car positioning only after the motorcycle loop demonstrates repeat value.
